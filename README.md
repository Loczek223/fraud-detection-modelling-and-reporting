# Fraud Detection Modelling and Reporting

## Background

Data-driven fraud detection reveals fraud patterns and predicts future fraud activities to safeguard customer assets in banking. This research analyses anonimised real-world fraud datasets, reports insights via dashboards, and models fraud patterns to predict future fraud activities.

This covers the entire lifecycle from data cleansing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modelling, to performance metrics evaluation. The interpretation of key steps is available in markdown documentation to illustrate model design.

## Datasets
